This is a reproducible report using a cutting-edge language agnostic data analysis framework. This is a Quarto website project rendereded from .QMD files in the style of a website, so it includes custom CSS/SCSS styling. It utilizes a _'renv'_ or reproducible R-environment, so the computational environment can be restored from files contained in this repository on your local system. I have found the Posit/Rstudio/R ecosystem, is truly geared towards data and creating approachable, user-friendly, and beautiful outputs. I hope you enjoy this project and find inspiration for creating your own future projects. That said, I like using Rstudio for these kinds of projects, but it could also be reproduced in IDEs such as VScode.  

## Summary
* Bridges a new language agnostic data analysis framework with more traditional HTML/CSS/JS type web development frameworks
* Reproducible, eye-catching visualizations
