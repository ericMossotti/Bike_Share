    "text": "1.3 Design\nAnother worthy objective of this analysis is to achieve reproducibility and efficiency. To facilitate future research and enable subsequent analyst teams to build upon this work, the project aimed to provide adequate code documentation and adhere to best practices regarding clean and modular code.\nFor instance, certain design decisions were incorporated to eliminate the need for re-downloading and re-processing data. For analysts conducting analysis over an extended period, such as days or months, on this dataset, it is now possible to simply reconnect to the single database file containing all the original data, including tables generated throughout the analysis process, following the initial download and subsequent processing.\nThe underlying code incorporates an if-else decision, which includes a source code script responsible for handling the initial data processing and establishing the database filesystem. Opting for a persistent DuckDB filesystem (as opposed to a purely in-memory solution) appeared optimal in terms of simplicity, cost-effectiveness of SQL database queries, and retaining progress made over extended periods. (Why DuckDB)\n\nWhy DuckDB. https://duckdb.org/why_duckdb.html\nTo streamline the process, reduce code duplication, and maintain consistent formatting throughout the project, reusable functions were developed for generating most of the tables and figures. These functions are located in the “Scripts” folder within the working directory. Their modular design not only simplifies the implementation of formatting changes but also facilitates the integration of additional code snippets when necessary. For instance, certain plots might require limiting the range of the axes, which can be achieved by combining these functions with appropriate code addendum. By leveraging these functions, the project benefits from reduced redundancy, improved efficiency, and cohesive formatting across all visualizations and data representations."

This section covers the process of checking for duplicates and selectively removing them while exercising caution. It is essential to recognize that the presence of unique values in a single column does not necessarily guarantee the uniqueness of each observation or row.\nWhile all values in the ride_id column were found to be unique, not all observations were truly distinct. To verify the uniqueness of each observation, additional columns such as start_time, end_time, start_station, and end_station were utilized.

In that scenario, each bike would be assigned a unique ride_id. However, this occurrence was relatively rare, happening only 18 times over the course of a year. Since there is only one duplicate for each instance, it raises concerns and warrants further investigation. It is possible that trips could be grouped where one person pays for another rider’s fare. However, if that were the case, it raises the question of why there is always precisely one duplicate.\nIn Table 3, duplicate observations are listed and grouped by color for visual clarity. In contrast, Table 4 presents the data after removing the extra copy of each duplicate observation while preserving the unique observations. Of the duplicates identified, each had one extra copy. It was noted that the number of rows in the duplicates table is 36. Each duplicated observation has one duplicate, where n (the count) is always 2. Therefore, the expected number of observations to be removed was 18. A complication arose in determining how to remove not all observations but only the extra duplicate observation from each group.\n\n\n\nCodegt_undupes &lt;- undupedTable |&gt;\ndplyr::collect() |&gt;\ndplyr::group_by(started_at) |&gt;\ngt::gt(\nrowname_col = \"row\",\ngroupname_col = \"started_at\",\nrow_group_as_column = TRUE\n) |&gt;\ngt::fmt_number(decimals = 0) |&gt;\ngt::tab_style(\nstyle = list(\ngt::cell_text(weight = \"bold\", align = \"center\"),\ngt::cell_borders(sides = c(\"bottom\"))\n),\nlocations = gt::cells_column_labels(gt::everything())\n) |&gt;\ngt::tab_style(\nstyle = list(\ngt::cell_borders(sides = c(\"left\", \"right\")),\ngt::cell_text(align = \"center\", v_align = \"middle\")\n),\nlocations = gt::cells_body(gt::everything())\n) |&gt;\ngt::data_color(\ncolumns = start_station_name,\ntarget_columns = gt::everything(),\nmethod = \"auto\",\npalette = \"basetheme::brutal\"\n) |&gt;\ngt::tab_header(title = \"After duplicates were removed\", subtitle = \"Same grouping\") |&gt;\ngt::tab_options(\nheading.title.font.weight = \"bolder\",\nheading.subtitle.font.weight = \"lighter\",\nheading.align = \"center\",\ntable.background.color = \"transparent\",\ntable.font.color = \"SeaShell\",\ntable.font.size = gt::pct(75)\n) |&gt;\ngt::tab_source_note(source_note = gt::md(\"**Source**: `db/data_complete.db`\"))\n\ngt_undupes\n\n\nTable 4: Un-duplicated Table\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter duplicates were removed\n\n\nSame grouping\n\n\n\nstart_station_name\nended_at\nend_station_name\n\n\n\n\n2023-02-19 12:10:52\nOrleans St & Merchandise Mart Plaza\n2023-02-19 12:24:04\nGreen St & Randolph St*\n\n\n2023-04-15 15:56:18\nKedzie Ave & 45th St\n2023-04-15 16:01:54\nFairfield Ave & 44th St\n\n\n2023-04-21 09:45:26\nMichigan Ave & 8th St\n2023-04-21 10:01:23\nWentworth Ave & Cermak Rd*\n\n\n2023-07-08 18:22:07\nMilwaukee Ave & Grand Ave\n2023-07-08 18:37:31\nBissell St & Armitage Ave*\n\n\n2023-07-08 18:58:14\nClark St & Schiller St\n2023-07-08 19:08:47\nBissell St & Armitage Ave*\n\n\n2023-07-09 18:00:17\nWells St & Hubbard St\n2023-07-09 18:40:49\nFort Dearborn Dr & 31st St*\n\n\n2023-07-10 20:10:41\nClark St & Newport St\n2023-07-10 20:19:59\nLincoln Ave & Roscoe St*\n\n\n2023-07-15 10:48:09\nRacine Ave & Wrightwood Ave\n2023-07-15 10:58:22\nBissell St & Armitage Ave*\n\n\n2023-07-15 19:38:51\nAvondale Ave & Irving Park Rd\n2023-07-15 19:55:04\nPublic Rack - Hamlin Ave & Fullerton Ave\n\n\n2023-07-23 11:41:36\nBurnham Harbor\n2023-07-23 12:07:13\nFort Dearborn Dr & 31st St*\n\n\n2023-07-25 18:08:47\nWabash Ave & Roosevelt Rd\n2023-07-25 18:21:45\nWentworth Ave & Cermak Rd*\n\n\n2023-07-26 21:10:55\nBurnham Harbor\n2023-07-26 21:28:44\nFort Dearborn Dr & 31st St*\n\n\n2023-08-05 19:40:37\nMorgan St & Lake St*\n2023-08-05 20:08:35\nMorgan St & Lake St*\n\n\n2023-08-12 17:46:53\nCalumet Ave & 18th St\n2023-08-12 17:57:40\nWentworth Ave & Cermak Rd*\n\n\n2023-08-17 12:23:50\nDuSable Lake Shore Dr & Monroe St\n2023-08-17 12:37:45\nStreeter Dr & Grand Ave\n\n\n2023-09-03 14:55:59\nBissell St & Armitage Ave*\n2023-09-03 15:58:21\nBissell St & Armitage Ave*\n\n\n2023-09-25 17:38:05\nFairbanks Ct & Grand Ave\n2023-09-25 17:52:29\nDuSable Lake Shore Dr & North Blvd\n\n\n2023-10-10 13:22:51\nLoomis St & Lexington St\n2023-10-10 13:29:37\nMorgan St & Polk St\n\n\n\n\nSource: db/data_complete.db\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo ensure the accurate removal of duplicates, the count of distinct n-values (representing the number of occurrences) for the un-duplicated table was computed, confirming the expected 18 unique instances. Subsequently, the total number of observations in the dataset was recorded, initially standing at 4,331,707. After removing the identified duplicate observations, the correct count of observations was 4,331,689. In summary, 18 additional observations were successfully removed, aligning with the expected number of duplicates identified earlier. These steps are documented in Table 5 for reference.\nBy carefully analyzing the count of distinct n-values and the total occurrences before and after reduplication, it was ensured that only the precise number of duplicate observations was removed, preserving the integrity of the unique data while eliminating the identified duplicates. This meticulous approach to data cleaning is crucial for maintaining data quality and reliability throughout the analysis process.\n\n\n\nCode used for handling duplicates in this section"

Additionally, trips lasting less than a minute but greater than zero were noted and removed, as they could potentially skew the derived statistics. These extremely short trips might be attributed to users briefly trying out the service before committing or quickly realizing their dissatisfaction with it. While some observations seemed nonsensical, most of the data was retained.\nConsistent with the previous approach, an if-else decision was employed to facilitate testing.

    "text": "3.2 Cycle Types\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 10 and Figure 2 present the overall frequency distribution for choice of bicycle.\nLikewise, Table 11 and Figure 3 summarize the choice of bicycle with the addtion of a grouped sum by the membership status.\n\nTable 12 presents a Chi-Square analysis of bicycle type usage among casual users and members.\n\nMembers show a higher preference for classic bikes (65%) compared to casual users (59%). Casual users have a higher proportion of electric bike usage (41%) compared to members (35%).\nThere is a statistically significant association between bicycle type and membership status (p &lt; 0.001). The very low p-value indicates strong evidence against the null hypothesis of no association between bicycle type and membership status. This suggests that the choice of bicycle type is not independent of membership status.\nThe large \\(\\chi^2\\) value (14762.37) with just 1 degree of freedom (calculated as [rows - 1] [columns - 1])* results in the very small p-value (&lt; 0.001). This combination strongly suggests that the difference in bicycle preference between casual users and members is not due to random chance. However, with such a large sample size (nearly 4 million total users), even small differences can produce statistically significant results.\n\n\n\nTable 13 presents the results of a binary logistic regression analyzing the relationship between bicycle type and membership status. The analysis compares classic bikes and electric bikes, with classic bikes serving as the reference category.\n\nThe odds of membership for users of electric bikes were 0.76 times the odds for users of classic bikes. The difference in membership likelihood between electric and classic bike users is highly statistically significant (p &lt; 0.001).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDatabase Operations\n\n\nTable

    "text": "3.3 Duration\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 16 and Figure 4 give an idea of the overall travel duration distribution. The data were rounded to the nearest minute for these figures.\nLikewise, Table 17 and Figure 5 summarize the travel duration distribution, where frequencies were summed by membership status.\nTable 18 sheds light on the variability, range, and quartile information about the duration data.\nTo accompany the summary table, two plots, Figure 6 and Figure 7, present a highly granular view of the duration dataset (the solid yellow line represents the mean). Quartile ranges are likewise shown to help understand the variability.\n\nSupplementing the histogram, Figure 8 shows a density plot comparing the duration of trips for casual users and members. The x-axis represents time in minutes, limited to a range of 0 to 100 for presentation purposes, while the y-axis shows the density (a measure of relative frequency).\n\nBoth groups exhibit right-skewed distributions, with a peak near the left side and a long tail extending to the right. This suggests that for both groups, a shorter duration is more common, while a longer duration occurs less frequently but can extend quite far.\nThe member group (darker blue) has a higher and narrower peak compared to the casual group (lighter blue). This indicates that members tend to have more concentrated distribution of a session duration around their most common length.\nThe casual group appears to have a slightly fatter tail, extending further to the right than the member group. This suggests that casual users might occasionally have longer sessions than members, even if it’s less common.\nBoth groups seem to have their peak density around 5-10 minutes, with members peaking slightly earlier than casual users.\nThere’s significant overlap between the two distributions, indicating that while there are differences, there is also considerable similarity in duration patterns between casual users and members.\n\n\n\nTable 19 presents the results of a binary logistic regression model, analyzing the relationship between ride duration and membership status. The analysis divides ride duration into quartiles, with Q1 (1.02 - 5.73 minutes) serving as the reference category.\n\nCompared to Q1, the odds of being a member versus a casual rider varied significantly across the other duration quartiles (p &lt; 0.001 for all comparisons).\nIn Q2 (5.73 - 9.55 minutes), the odds of membership were 0.38 times as high as in Q1. This indicates a substantial decrease (62%) in the likelihood of membership for slightly longer rides.\nIn Q3 (9.55 - 16.13 minutes), the odds of membership were 0.08 times as high as in Q1. This shows a dramatic decrease (92%) in membership likelihood for medium-length rides.\nIn Q4 (16.13 - 475.22 minutes), the odds of membership were 0.06 times as high as in Q1. This represents an even more pronounced decrease (94%) in membership likelihood for the longest rides.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDatabase Operations\n\n\nTable Preview\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDB

    "text": "3.4 Month\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 22 and Figure 9 shows the overall monthly travel distribution.\nSimilarly, Table 23 and Figure 10 summarize the monthly travel, where frequencies were summed by membership status.\n\nIn Table 24 presentes a Chi-Square of monthly travel among members and casual users.\n\nMembers exhibit higher usage during the months of Jan - Mar and Oct - Dec.\nBoth groups prefer the months of Apr - Sep, where casuals show a higher interest, proportionally for their respective group.\nThere is a statistically significant association between monthly travel and membership status (p &lt; 0.001). The very low p-value indicates strong evidence against the null hypothesis of no association between monthly travel and membership status. The frequency of monthly travel is not likely to be independent of membership status.\nThe large \\(\\chi^2\\) value (71802.26) with 11 degrees of freedom (calculated as [rows - 1] [columns - 1])* results in the very small p-value. This combination strongly suggests that the difference in monthly preferences between casual users and members is not due to random chance. However, with such a large sample size (nearly 4 million total users), even small differences can produce statistically significant results.\n\n\nTwo plots, Figure 11 and Figure 12, present a highly granular view of the monthly data (the solid yellow line represents the mean). Quartile ranges are likewise shown to help understand the variability.\n\nTo visualize monthly users through the lens of their respective concentrations, see Figure 13. The plot looks a little different because date-time data was used directly when plotting the x-axis. The y-axis shows the density (a measure of relative frequency).\n\nThe casual group has higher peaks near the middle of the distribution.\nThe member group has higher peaks near the left and right sides of the distribution.\nBoth of the groups exhibit somewhat normal, multi-modal distributions.\nBoth groups overlap the other signficantly, suggesting similarity in travel patterns.\n\n\n\nTable 25 presents the results of a binary logistic regression analyzing the relationship between months of the year and membership status. The analysis divides the year into quartiles, with Q1 (January 01 - May 20) serving as the reference category.\n\nCompared to Q1, the odds of being a member versus a casual rider varied significantly across the other time quartiles (p &lt; 0.001 for all comparisons).\nIn Q2 (May 20 - Jul 21), the odds of membership were 0.57 times as high as in Q1. This indicates a substantial decrease (43%) in the likelihood of membership during late spring and early summer.\nIn Q3 (Jul 21 - Sep 18), the odds of membership were 0.58 times as high as in Q1. This shows a similar decrease (42%) in membership likelihood during late summer and early fall, nearly identical to Q2.\nIn Q4 (Sep 18 - Dec 31), the odds of membership were 0.87 times as high as in Q1. While still lower than Q1, this represents a less pronounced decrease (13%) in membership likelihood during fall and early winter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDatabase Operations\n\n\nTable

    "text": "3.5 Day\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 27 and Figure 14 show an aggregated distribution of the overall daily travel.\nSimilarly, Table 28 and Figure 15 summarize the duration distribution, grouping sums by membership status.\n\nIn Table 29, present a Chi-Square of daily travel among members and casual users.\n\nMembers show higher usage Mon - Thu compared to casual users. The pattern is flatter compared to casual users.\nCasual users show higher usage Fri - Sun compared to members. Their preferences fall within the weekend.\nThere is a statistically significant association between daily travel and membership status (p &lt; 0.001). The very low p-value indicates strong evidence against the null hypothesis of no association between daily travel and membership status. The frequency of monthly travel is not likely to be independent of membership status.\nThe large \\(\\chi^2\\) value (76305.71) with 6 degrees of freedom (calculated as [rows - 1] [columns - 1])* results in the very small p-value. This combination strongly suggests that the difference in monthly preferences between casual users and members is not due to random chance. However, with such a large sample size (nearly 4 million total users), even small differences can produce statistically significant results.\n\n\nTwo plots, Figure 16 and Figure 17, present a highly granular view of the daily data (the solid yellow line represents the mean). Quartile ranges are likewise shown to help visualize the variability.\n\nTo visualize daily users through the lens of their respective concentrations, see Figure 18 The plot looks a little different because date-time data was used directly when plotting the x-axis. The y-axis shows the density (a measure of relative frequency).\n\nThe casual group has higher peaks near the left and right sides of the distribution. Their highest peak appears to be on Saturday.\nThe member group has higher peaks near the middle of the distribution. They also show less day-to-day variability during weekdays compared to casual users.\nOn weekdays, both groups show a bimodal distribution, with two peaks each day. On weekends, there is a unimodal distribution.\nBoth groups overlap the other signficantly, suggesting similarity in travel patterns.\n\n\n\nTable 30 presents the results of a binary logistic regression analyzing the relationship between days of the week and membership status. The analysis divides the week into quartiles, with Q1 (Sunday 12:00 am - Monday 11:40 am) serving as the reference category.\n\nCompared to Q1, the odds of being a member versus a casual rider varied significantly across the other time quartiles (p &lt; 0.001 for all comparisons).\nQ2 (Monday 11:40 am - Wednesday 05:14 am): The odds of membership were 1.52 times higher than in Q1. This suggests a substantial increase in the likelihood of members riding during the early part of the work week.\nQ3 (Wednesday 05:14 am - Friday 12:19 pm), the odds of membership were 1.36 times higher than in Q1. This indicates a continued higher likelihood of membership during the latter part of the work week, though slightly lower than Q2.\nQ4 (Friday 12:19 pm - Saturday 11:59 pm), the odds of membership were 0.80 times as high as in Q1. This represents a significant decrease in the likelihood of membership during the weekend period.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDatabase Operations\n\n\nTable Preview\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDB

The very low p-value indicates strong evidence against the null hypothesis of no association between hourly travel and membership status. The frequency of hourly travel is not likely to be independent of membership status.\nThe large \\(\\chi^2\\) value (72733.38) with 23 degrees of freedom (calculated as [rows - 1] [columns - 1])* results in the very small p-value. This combination strongly suggests that the difference in monthly preferences between casual users and members is not due to random chance.

The plot looks a little different because date-time data was used directly when plotting the x-axis.

The analysis divides the day into quartiles, with Q1 (12:00 am - 10:59 am) serving as the reference category.\n\nCompared to Q1, the odds of being a member versus a casual rider varied significantly across the other time quartiles (p &lt; 0.001 for all comparisons).\nSpecifically, the odds of membership were 1.44 times as high in Q2 (10:59 am - 03:24 pm), 1.04 times as high in Q3 (03:24 pm - 06:05 pm), and 0.97 times as high in Q4 (06:05 pm - 11:59 pm).\nThese results reveal a non-linear relationship between time of day and membership status. The highest likelihood of membership occurs during \\(Q2\\), corresponding to midday hours.\nThere’s a slight increase in membership likelihood during Q3 (late afternoon) compared to the reference

Quartile ranges are likewise shown to help visualize the variability.\n\nTo visualize monthly users through the lens of their respective concentrations, see Figure 28. The y-axis shows the density (a measure of relative frequency).\n\nThe member group has a narrower, taller spike in between 0.1 and 1 mile distances. There is less of a concentration than the casual group between the 1-3 mile distances.\nThe casual group displays a broader spike with much overlap to the member group, but peaks closer to the 1 mile mark than for members. There is greater concentration than members between the 1-3 miles distances, but less around the 0.1-1 mile distance.\nBoth groups overlap nearly completely from around the 3 miles mark and onwards.\n\n\n\nTable 42 presents the odds ratios for membership status across distance quartiles, with Q1 serving as the reference category.\n\nCompared to Q1, the odds of being a member versus a casual rider were significantly lower in all other quartiles (p &lt; 0.001 for all comparisons).\nSpecifically, the odds of membership were 0.63 times as high in Q2, 0.59 times as high in Q3, and 0.65 times as high in Q4.\nThese results indicate an inverse relationship between ride distance and membership status, with members generally associated with shorter ride distances.\nInterestingly, the lowest odds of membership were observed in Q3, rather than Q4, suggesting a non-linear relationship between distance and membership likelihood.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDatabase Operations\n\n\nTable

Quartile ranges are likewise shown to help visualize the variability.\n\nTo visualize travel speed patterns through the lens of their respective concentrations, see Figure 33. The y-axis shows the density (a measure of relative frequency).\n\nThe member group has a narrower, taller spike centering around 7mph. There is higher concentration than the casual group between ~ 5-15mph.\nThe casual group has a broader, shorter spike centering closer to 6mph. There is higher concentration than the member group between ~ 1-5mph.\nThere is a lot of overlap, and both groups have a unimodal distribution.\n\n\n\nTable 48 presents the odds ratios for membership status across speed quartiles, with Q1 serving as the reference category.\n\nCompared to Q1, the odds of being a member versus a casual rider were significantly higher in all other quartiles (p &lt; 0.001 for all comparisons).\nSpecifically, the odds of membership were 2.09 times higher in Q2, 2.50 times higher in Q3, and 2.69 times higher in Q4.\nThese results suggest a strong positive association between riding speed and membership status, with the likelihood of membership increasing monotonically across speed quartiles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDatabase Operations\n\n\nTable

    "text": "3.9 Summarizing Tabsets\nThe EDA (exploratory data analysis) sections employ various statistical methods to uncover patterns in user behavior and preferences. A chi-square analysis reveals a significant association between bicycle type and membership status (p &lt; 0.001). Binary logistic regression further quantifies this relationship, showing that electric bike users have lower odds of being members compared to classic bike users. Section 3.2\nTrip duration analysis, also utilizing binary logistic regression, uncovers a notable trend: the odds of membership decrease substantially as trip duration increases. This model, using quartiles of trip duration, indicates that members generally take shorter, more concentrated trips, while casual users are more likely to engage in longer rides. Section 3.3\nSeasonal trends emerge when examining monthly ridership patterns through another logistic regression model. The odds of membership fluctuate throughout the year, with the highest proportion of members riding during the colder months and early spring. As the weather warms, there’s a noticeable shift towards more casual ridership, as evidenced by lower odds ratios in the summer months. Section 3.4\nWeekly and daily patterns, analyzed using similar regression techniques, provide further insights into user behavior. Weekdays, Section 3.5, particularly during typical commuting hours, Section 3.6, see higher odds of member rides. In contrast, weekends and evenings show decreased odds of membership, suggesting an increased likelihood of casual ridership during these times.\nThe analysis of trip distances, again using logistic regression with distance quartiles, reveals an inverse relationship with membership status. Members are more likely to take shorter trips, while casual users tend to embark on longer journeys. This aligns with the duration findings and reinforces the idea that members use the service for quick, routine travel. Section 3.3\nInterestingly, trip speed shows a strong positive association with membership status in the logistic regression model. The odds of membership increase monotonically across speed quartiles, indicating that members generally ride at higher speeds compared to casual users. Section 3.8\nThese findings, derived from a combination of chi-square tests for independence and multiple binary logistic regression models, paint a picture of two distinct user groups: members who typically use the bike share for short, fast, routine trips during weekdays, and casual users who tend to take longer, slower rides, often during leisure hours or weekends.\nContingency tables and visualizations, including density plots and histograms, supplement these statistical analyses, providing a comprehensive view of the data distribution across various parameters such as bike type, trip duration, time of day, and day of the week.\nThe robust statistical approach, combining hypothesis testing (chi-square) with predictive modeling (logistic regression), provides strong evidence for the observed patterns in user behavior. These insights could prove valuable for tailoring marketing strategies, optimizing bike distribution, and enhancing service offerings to better serve both user segments."

(2019)] This R package used for creating this graph was re-purposed from its original intent for visualizing the spread of disease. This visualization employs a network of nodes (circles) connected by lines, where the thickness of the lines roughly corresponds to the volume of trips between the nodes, with thicker lines indicating a higher number of trips. The top 34 most frequently traveled stations are depicted in this visual network diagram.\n\nMoraga, P., Dorigatti, I., Kamvar, Z. N., Piatkowski, P., Toikkanen, S. E., Nagraj, V. P., Donnelly, C.

Additionally, a drop-down window provides further exploration capabilities, enabling users to delve deeper into the data.\nThese stations represent the most active locations within the system.

This intersection happens to be at the heart of the University of Chicago campus. The natural next question is: where does the traffic to and from this location typically flow? By selecting one of the other nodes highlighted with flows directing away from the previous node, the user can identify Kimbark Ave and 53rd St. As seen in the map view, this location is situated adjacent to the Vue 53 Apartments complex. By analyzing such connections between nodes, the user can gain insights into common routes and destinations originating from a particular point of interest, potentially revealing patterns related to student housing, campus facilities, or other points of interest in the vicinity.\nThe data suggests individual members utilize the service multiple times weekly. However, further analysis is needed to determine if a significantly larger volume of unique individuals are annual members. Verifying associations between specific locations and higher or lower traffic could be a next step. Preliminary observations indicate universities, shopping centers, major companies, and nearby apartment complexes tend to have the highest ridership volumes.\nTo improve membership, addressing factors deterring individuals from becoming annual members could be key. These may include a lack of stations within walking distance of residences or destinations, or concerns over electric bicycle battery life and charging station availability, potentially explaining their lower utilization compared to classic bikes. Offering trial periods could allow casual users to experience the service’s reliability and convenience, encouraging conversion to annual memberships."
