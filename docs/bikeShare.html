<p>Of the other columns, it seems that the start_time, end_time, start_station, and end_station could show if there are possibly hidden duplicated observations.</p>
<p>We started with 5,719,877 observations (obs) for dates spanning January to December, 2023, then removed 1,388,170 incomplete obs.</p>
<p>I assumed that having the same times/dates and stations for two different ride IDs was a mistake. Although, I do not know how that error would happen. I could have assumed one person could check out multiple bikes at once. In that instance, each bike could be assigned a unique ride_id. That, however, has only happened 18 times over a year. Since it’s only one copy every time, that also raises a red flag. I did not notice any other correlations with station_id/name, member_casual, or ride_type for those particular duplicated data.</p>

<p>By applying distinct() on dupeTable, we see the only distinct value is 2. We can safely conclude that, of the duplicates, each has a minimum and maximum of 1 extra copy.</p>
<p>Number of rows in the dupeTable is 36. Because each duplicated observation has one duplicate (n = 2), expected removed nobs is 18. The issue is that we need to get rid of not all 36 rows, but just the 1 extra duplicate observation from each, resulting in the expected 18.</p>

<h1>Frequency Tables and What They Tell Us</h1>
<p>Now we’re going to create dimension and frequency tables and add those to our database. We can retain the outliers in those tables and perhaps filter as needed later. This is a good place start. If needed, we can dive deeper into other statistical techniques or adjust parameters in these code chunks and overwrite or create new db tables.</p>
<p>By generating frequency tables, I quickly glean insights from the data.</p>

<p>This indicates that there are nearly twice as many trips taken by annual subscribers than by casual users. So, it would seem that there is some correlation between how often a person uses the service and whether they choose to subscribe to an annual membership plan.</p>

<p>This tells us that there are nearly twice as many trips taken with non-electric bikes as electric bikes. There are differences in cost for casual members, so that might be one determining factor. Also, perhaps the associated health benefits with exercise would help explain higher non-electric bicycle use.</p>

<p>This shows that around 0.3 to 3 miles is the distance traveled on most trips taken. The fact that casual bicycles are used more often perhaps makes a little more sense given that people are not traveling long distances.</p>

<p>There is a slight reduction in trips taken on Sundays and Mondays. This could be explained by the fact that most trips are taken by annual subscribers, possibly because they are biking to work and such. Much less people will be biking to work on Sundays. Taking 3-day weekends is common in the workplace, where most would likely opt to use up their sick/vacation days on Monday, which might explain the down tick in trips taken on Mondays. Also, those who are working Tuesdays-Saturdays could be taking Sunday and Mondays off.</p>

<p>The 5th decimal place is accurate up to 1.1m, so there ends up being groupings for bikes rented from stations located along a street or at intersections of two streets. You can tell by the start_station_name. If it’s an intersection it will say something like “1st St &amp; 2nd St.”. If it’s one street, it will likely just say “1st St”. There are likely some exceptions to that rule. That helps explain why the geospatial coordinates slightly differ for entries with the same stations and IDs.</p>

Although, I do not know how that error would happen. I could have assumed one person could check out multiple bikes at once. In that instance, each bike could be assigned a unique ride_id. That, however, has only happened 18 times over a year. Since it's only one copy every time, that also raises a red flag. I did not notice any other correlations with station_id/name, member_casual, or ride_type for those particular duplicated data.</span>

Taking 3-day weekends is common in the workplace, where most would likely opt to use up their sick/vacation days on Monday, which might explain the down tick in trips taken on Mondays. Also, those who are working Tuesdays-Saturdays could be taking Sunday and Mondays off. </span>

You can tell by the start_station_name. If it's an intersection it will say something like "1st St &amp; 2nd St.". If it's one street, it will likely just say "1st St". There are likely some exceptions to that rule. That helps explain why the geospatial coordinates slightly differ for entries with the same stations and IDs.</span>
