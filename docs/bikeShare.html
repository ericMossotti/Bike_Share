<p>We started with 5,719,877 observations (obs) for dates spanning January to December, 2023, then removed 1,388,170 incomplete obs.</p>
<p>Of the other columns, it seems that the start_time, end_time, start_station, and end_station could show if there are possibly hidden duplicated observations. Those 4 variables combined results in the most granular view of any one observation. Meaning, that data would naturally only have duplicates in error.</p>
<p>I assumed that having the same times/dates and stations for two different ride IDs was a mistake. Although, I do not know how that error would happen. I could have assumed one person could check out multiple bikes at once. In that instance, each bike could be assigned a unique ride_id. That, however, has only happened 18 times over a year. Since it’s only one copy every time, that also raises a red flag. I did not notice any other correlations with station_id/name, member_casual, or ride_type for those particular duplicated data.</p>

<p>By applying distinct() on dupeTable, we see the only distinct value is 2. We can safely conclude that, of the duplicates, each has a minimum and maximum of 1 extra copy.</p>
<p>Number of rows in the dupeTable is 36. Because each duplicated observation has one duplicate (n = 2), expected removed nobs is 18. The issue is that we need to get rid of not all 36 rows, but just the 1 extra duplicate observation from each, resulting in the expected 18.</p>

That, however, has only happened 18 times over a year. Since it's only one copy every time, that also raises a red flag.
