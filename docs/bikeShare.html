<p>We started with 5,719,877 observations (obs) for dates spanning January to December, 2023, then removed 1,388,170 incomplete obs.</p>
<p>Of the other columns, it seems that the start_time, end_time, start_station, and end_station could show if there are possibly hidden duplicated observations. Those 4 variables combined results in the most granular view of any one observation. Meaning, that data would naturally only have duplicates in error.</p>
<p>I assumed that having the same times/dates and stations for two different ride IDs was a mistake. Although, I do not know how that error would happen. I could have assumed one person could check out multiple bikes at once. In that instance, each bike could be assigned a unique ride_id. That, however, has only happened 18 times over a year. Since it’s only one copy every time, that also raises a red flag. I did not notice any other correlations with station_id/name, member_casual, or ride_type for those particular duplicated data.</p>

<p>By applying distinct() on dupeTable, we see the only distinct value is 2. We can safely conclude that, of the duplicates, each has a minimum and maximum of 1 extra copy.</p>
<p>Number of rows in the dupeTable is 36. Because each duplicated observation has one duplicate (n = 2), expected removed nobs is 18. The issue is that we need to get rid of not all 36 rows, but just the 1 extra duplicate observation from each, resulting in the expected 18.</p>

<p>The count of observed distinct values for the un-duplicated table was indeed 18. So now, it is time to run a count of how rows/observations are in the dataset. There is a difference, though, concerning the correct amount.</p>

<p>The incorrect number of observations (nobs) was 4,331,707. The correct nobs after removing duplicated obs was 4,331,689. In short, 18 additional obs were removed.</p>

<p>To ensure the conclusions are accurate, outliers should be filtered. Negative and very low trip times might skew trends. The underlying reason for very low trip times is somewhat of an unknown. Perhaps people often change their minds?</p>

That, however, has only happened 18 times over a year. Since it's only one copy every time, that also raises a red flag.
